# EXPERIMENT 3: Simulation of All Flip-Flops using Blocking Statement

## AIM
To design and simulate basic flip-flops (SR, D, JK, and T) using **blocking statements** in Verilog HDL, and verify their functionality through simulation in Vivado 2023.1.

## APPARATUS REQUIRED
- Vivado 2023.1
- Computer with HDL Simulator

## DESCRIPTION
Flip-flops are the basic memory elements in sequential circuits.  
In this experiment, different types of flip-flops (SR, D, JK, T) are modeled using **behavioral modeling** with **blocking assignment (`=`)** inside the `always` block.  
Blocking assignments execute sequentially in the given order, which makes it easier to describe simple synchronous circuits.

## PROCEDURE
1. Open **Vivado 2023.1**.  
2. Create a **New RTL Project** (e.g., `FlipFlop_Simulation`).  
3. Add Verilog source files for each flip-flop (SR, D, JK, T).  
4. Add a testbench file to verify all flip-flops.  
5. Run **Behavioral Simulation**.  
6. Observe waveforms of inputs and outputs for each flip-flop.  
7. Verify that outputs match the truth table.  
8. Save results and capture simulation screenshots.
